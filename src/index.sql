-- Welcome to SQLPage ! This is a short demonstration of a few things you can do with SQLPage
-- Using the 'shell' component at the top allows you to customize your web page, giving it a title and a description
SELECT 'shell' AS component,
  'ðŸ‘ŒSQL Project' AS title,
  TRUE AS fixed_top_menu,
  'dark' AS theme,
  'golf' AS icon,
-- -- Making a web page with SQLPage works by using a set of predefined "components"
-- --  and filling them with contents from the results of your SQL queries
-- select 'hero' as component, -- We select a component. The documentation for each component can be found on https://sql-page.com/documentation.sql
--     'It works !' as title, -- 'title' is top-level parameter of the 'hero' component
--     'If you can see this, then SQLPage v' ||
--     sqlpage.version() ||
--     ' is running correctly on your server. Congratulations! ' as description;
-- -- Properties can be textual, numeric, or booleans

-- -- Let's start with the text component
-- SELECT 'text' as component, -- We can switch to another component at any time just with a select statement.
--     'Get started' as title;
-- -- We are now inside the text component. Each row that will be returned by our SELECT queries will be a span of text
-- -- The text component has a property called "contents" that can be  that we use to set the contents of our block of text
-- -- and a property called "center" that we use to center the text
-- SELECT 'In order to get started, visit ' as contents;
-- select 'SQLPage''s website' as contents,
--     'https://sql-page.com/your-first-sql-website/' as link,
--     1 as italics;
-- SELECT '. You can replace this page''s contents by creating a file named ' as contents;
-- SELECT 'index.sql' as contents, 1 as code;
-- SELECT ' in the folder where sqlpage is running (current working directory: ' as contents;
-- SELECT sqlpage.current_working_directory() as contents, 1 as code;
-- SELECT ').' as contents;
-- SELECT 'You can customize your server''s [configuration](https://github.com/sqlpage/SQLPage/blob/main/configuration.md)
-- by creating a file in `' || sqlpage.current_working_directory() || '/sqlpage/sqlpage.json`.' as contents_md;

-- SELECT '
-- Alternatively, you can create a table called `sqlpage_files` in your database with the following columns: `path`, `contents`, and `last_modified`.' as contents_md;
