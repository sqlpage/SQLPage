Description: SQL-only webapp builder
 SQLPage is a web server that takes .sql files and formats the query
 results using pre-made configurable professional-looking components.
 .
 With SQLPage, you write simple .sql files containing queries to your
 database to select, group, update, insert, and delete your data, and
 you get good-looking clean webpages displaying your data as text,
 lists, grids, plots, and forms.
 .
 Supported databases include SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL
 Server, and any ODBC-compatible database such as ClickHouse, MongoDB,
 DuckDB, Oracle, Snowflake, BigQuery, and IBM DB2.
