# Corporate Conundrum: Decisions in Disguise

This is the web version of a board game, coded entirely in SQL.

## Pitch
Unleash your inner executive as you step into the shoes of top-level employees in a high-stakes corporate meeting. But beware, among your trusted colleagues lurks a cunning infiltrator sent by a rival company to sabotage your decision-making process. Will you be able to outsmart the saboteur and make the right choices to lead your company to success?

## Rules

**Objective**: As a team of genuine employees, your goal is to make accurate decisions based on challenging questions. The infiltrator's objective is to sway you toward incorrect answers.

**Gameplay**: Each turn, a question will be presented to the group. One player, secretly assigned as the infiltrator, will receive a specific wrong answer. They must cunningly lead others astray, while you must collaborate and deduce the correct answer.

**Discussion Phase**: Engage in lively debates and exchange ideas to uncover the truth. Analyze arguments, question motives, and use your critical thinking skills to navigate the murky waters of corporate deception.

**Hidden Votes**: After the discussion phase, all players simultaneously submit their individual answers privately, without revealing them to others.

**Answer Reveal**: Once all the answers are submitted, they are revealed simultaneously.

**Scoring System**: Points are awarded based on the proximity of each player's answer to the true answer.

 - If a player's answer is closer to the true answer than to the wrong answer provided by the saboteur, they earn one point.
 - Conversely, if a player's answer is closer to the wrong answer, they inadvertently contribute one point to the saboteur's score.

**Continuing Gameplay**: The game progresses with new questions and role assignments, allowing each player to take turns as the infiltrator. The player with the highest score at the end of the predetermined number of rounds wins the game.
