# Introduction video

## Canadians love SQLPage

The Kitchener-Waterloo Linux User Group had the pleasure of [hosting a presentation](https://kwlug.org/node/1374)
by Anton Avramov, an avid SQLPage user and community member, who gave a live demonstration of SQLPage.

## The video

The user group kindly invited me (Ophir, the initial creator and main contributor to SQLPage) 
to record a video introduction to SQLPage, which I did.

The video is a 5 minute introduction to the philosophy behind SQLPage,
followed by a 25 minute live demonstration of how to create
[this todo list application](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/tree/main/examples/todo%20application)
from scratch.

Watch it on youtube:
